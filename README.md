dertfiles
=========

My dotfiles - no frameworks, just symlinks

installation
============

```
git clone git@github.com:partkyle/dertfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd $!
./bin/dotfiles
```

*Note*: this is a destructive install, because it will delete any dotfiles it finds. I could make this interactive, but it hasn't been a problem yet.
